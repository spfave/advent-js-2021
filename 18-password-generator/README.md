## Users should be able to:
- The text input field should automatically update as the range field changes or one of the items is checked
- The user can click on the copy icon to the right of the input field to copy the password to their clipboard.
- When a user clicks on the copy icon, a class of "copied" should be added to the button. This will display the word "Copied" and change the text color to green.
- After 5 seconds, the "copied" class should be removed from the button.
The range slider should allow the user to change the password length. The minimum amount is 6 and the max is 32 (limits are imposed through the HTML element)
- Checking symbols will allow symbols to be used in the password
- Checking numbers will allow numbers to be used in the password
- Checking lowercase letters will allow lowercase letters to be used in the password
- Checking uppercase letters will allow uppercase letters to be used in the password
- Checking exclude similar letters will remove similar letters from the password (i, l, 1, L, o, 0, O)
