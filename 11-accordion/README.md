# **Day 11 Accordion**

## Brief
In this project, we're going to create expanding and collapsing sections. This functionality can be found in accordions or toggle displays.

## Users should be able to:
- Click on a collapsed question to expand it and view the answer.
- Click on a collapsed answer to collapse it and hide the answer.
