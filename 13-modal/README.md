# **Day 13 Modal**

## Brief
In this project, we're going to create a Custom Modal

You can use as many (or as few) tools, libraries, and frameworks as you'd like. If you're trying to learn something new, this would be a great way to push yourself.

## Users should be able to:
- Click on a point on the image, that triggers the modal
- Click on the x within the modal to close the modal
