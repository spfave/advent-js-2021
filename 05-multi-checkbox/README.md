# **Day 5 Multi Checkbox**

## Brief
In this project, we're going to check multiple checkboxes at one time.

You can use as many (or as few) tools, libraries, and frameworks as you'd like. If you're trying to learn something new, this would be a great way to push yourself.

**Users should be able to:**
- See the list of podcast episodes
- Check one episode, shift click to select all the episodes in between
