**Users should be able to:**
- See the keyboard centered on the page
- Whenever a user hovers over a specific key it will change colors
  - White keys will change to yellow `#ffd200`
  - Black keys will change to pink `#f40082`
- When a user clicks on a specific key, it will play an audio clip.
  - The audio clips are numbered, but I did not specifically number the keys. You can pick which key should be associated with each audio file.
  - If a user clicks on one key, then immediately clicks on a second key. The 2 files should both play. Meaning, clicking on one key will not stop an existing audio file from playing. 

## Getting Started
1. To get started, download the zip file. This includes all the project assets you need to get started: HTML, CSS, images, and fonts.
2. Take a look around. Look at the project's Figma file. This is a great way to see how the pieces and parts should look within the browser.
3. Open the project's `README.md` file. It has additional information on how the project is structured.
4. Customize your project / file architecture to your liking.
5. Happy coding!
6. Once you're finished, share your work using **#adventofjs**
