- When the user finishes (blur) entering a credit card number, change the credit card image to match the type of card they entered. You can add a class of `visa`, `mastercard`, `discover`, or `american` to line 16 in index.html
  - American Express cards always begin with the number 3- more specifically 34 or 37
  - Visa cards begin with the number 4.
  - Mastercards start with the number 5.
  - Discover Cards begin with the number 6.
- When the user enters the CVV number, have the card flip over by adding a class of `flip` on line 16 in index.html
