# **Day 19 Form Validator**

## Brief
In this project, we're creating a Form Validator.

## Users should be able to:
- When the user unfocuses a field, the form should perform a validation check
- All the fields are required
- Should enter a properly formatted email address
- The password and confirm password fields should match
- Clicking on the show / hide button on the password field should change the visibility of the password (simply change the input `type` from `password` to `text` or vice versa)
